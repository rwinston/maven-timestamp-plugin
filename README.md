This is an old plugin I wrote to enable a build timestamp to be injected into
a Maven build, which could be used in templated files and resource filtering tasks later.

The plugin is incredibly basic, and is now defunct, as Maven provides this capability 
out-of-the-box. It is a simple example of how to write a terribly basic plugin and inject
custom data into the project as a property.
